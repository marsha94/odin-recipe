                <li><strong>Boil the Lasagna Noodles:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil.</li>
                        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente (firm to the bite).</li>
                        <li>Drain the noodles and set them aside, separating them to prevent sticking.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Prepare the Meat Sauce:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef or Italian sausage until fully cooked and no longer pink.</li>
                        <li>Add the diced onions and minced garlic to the skillet. Sauté for a few minutes until the onions become translucent.</li>
                        <li>Stir in the tomato sauce, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
                        <li>Let the sauce simmer for about 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Remove it from heat.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Prepare the Cheese Mixture:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, and the egg. Mix until well blended.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                        <li>In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a small amount of the meat sauce on the bottom.</li>
                        <li>Place three lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.</li>
                        <li>Spread a portion of the ricotta cheese mixture evenly over the noodles.</li>
                        <li>Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over the ricotta layer.</li>
                        <li>Add more meat sauce on top of the cheese.</li>

                    </ul><br>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Bake the Lasagna:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil to prevent excessive browning.</li>
                        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the top is bubbly and lightly browned.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Let it Rest:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes. This helps the lasagna set and makes it easier to slice.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong>
